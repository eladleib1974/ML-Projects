    "A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when something blocks blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die. A stroke can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to theWorld Stroke Organization, 13 million people get a stroke each\n",
    "year, and approximately 5.5 million people will die as a result. It is the leading cause of\n",
    "death and disability worldwide, and that is why its imprint is serious in all aspects of life.\n",
    "Stroke not only affects the patient but also affects the patient’s social environment, family\n",
    "and workplace. In addition, contrary to popular belief, it can happen to anyone, at any age,\n",

    "In one survey, most respondents—93%—recognized sudden numbness on one side as a symptom of stroke. Only 38% were aware of all major symptoms and knew to call 9-1-1 when someone was having a stroke.4\n",
    "Patients who arrive at the emergency room within 3 hours of their first symptoms often have less disability 3 months after a stroke than those who received delayed care.4\n",
